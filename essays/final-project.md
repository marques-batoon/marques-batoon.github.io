## Overview 

Finding a toilet on campus that has a good clean to closeness ratio is always a lone struggle we studdents face each semester. We'd like to make this journey more collaborative by creating a social media web app where students are able to find nearest bathrooms to their location. 

The app will also allow students to rate a bathroom's cleanliness level and include things that others can be weary of. For example, the quality of soap in the bathroom, number of stalls, business at times of days, or if there are areas designated for users to place their belongings while using the premises.


## Mockup page ideas

After registering and signing in, users are able to gain access to the following content:
- **Homepage**: A random bathroom of the day will be featured based on user ratings.
- **Profile**: Each user will have their own profile page which will show their bathroom reviews.
-
