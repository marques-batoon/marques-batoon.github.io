What does it mean to ask a smart question? What does it mean to ask a stupid question? Nobody's perfect when it comes to programming, or anything in life. We're always learning and we should have that mindset. Having said that, throughout our learning processes we're all going to be stumped at some point. There will be times we reach a wall blocking us from progressing. At those times you'll have (hopefully) exhausted all of your resources that you have access to on your own and have decided: I. Need. Help. There's nothing wrong with asking for help. After all, you're not expected to have all of the answers. But in order to get the answers you need, it's important to do everything in your power to help the person helping you. The best way to do that is to ask smart questions.

## Smart Questions

In his essay, Eric Raymond provides [excellent guidelines](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) for effective communication styles when asking for help. Raymond explains that in order to help the questionee as much as possible, you as the questioner should provide as much support as possible. *Before* you ask your question, do your part and do as much research on the topic as possible. Use your resources available to you to find the answer. Whether that be via textbooks or googling, try to put in the effort before asking your question.
After exhausting all options and finding nothing, make sure you include that in your question. "According to this article by so-and-so they instructed me to do this but that yielded no results," Or "this forum I found seemed promising but after reading through it I found nothing related to my issue at hand."

A question asked by Alexander on StackOverflow showed signs of their own efforts and an excellent use of their own time and resources that were implemented before asking the question. Alexander asks wabout the difference between React$Element and ReactElement and using flow with ReactJS. They bring up an article that they looked into that yielded no results. They also include the many examples they found with links but the error still shows up. After showing specifically what error shows up, they include possible solutions that they tried and what actually worked. They ended up finding a solution using React$Element instead of ReactElement. They then asked why this worked and where they could find information about React$Element.
Alexander does a great job in asking specific questions and offering what they already know. They also show a want to learn about the issue at hand by asking for more resources that could help.

Thanks to Alexander's smart way of asking questions an answer was given that offered links and sample codes that explains the answer. They also offered alternate solutions that Alexander could look into for further research.

## Stupid Ways of Asking

In Raymond's essay he emphasizes that it's OKAY to be ignorant, but it's not okay to play stupid. If you don't show any effort to want to learn about the topic at hand, it shows. Just simply saying "help me" or "what is the solution?" is not a productive way of asking questions.

A question by bob george on StackOverflow was asked inquiring how to add a verticle line character at the beginning and end of their final print statement. They offer the python code they're working on and nothing else. Something that bob could have done to help the questionees is to offer what print statement they're getting and why it's different from what they were expecting.
