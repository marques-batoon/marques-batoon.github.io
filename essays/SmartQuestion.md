What does it mean to ask a smart question? What does it mean to ask a stupid question? Nobody's perfect when it comes to programming, or anything in life. We're always learning and we should have that mindset. Having said that, throughout our learning processes we're all going to be stumped at some point. There will be times we reach a wall blocking us from progressing. At those times you'll have (hopefully) exhausted all of your resources that you have access to on your own and have decided: I. Need. Help. There's nothing wrong with asking for help. After all, you're not expected to have all of the answers. But in order to get the answers you need, it's important to do everything in your power to help the person helping you. The best way to do that is to ask smart questions.

## Smart Questions

In his essay, Eric Raymond provides [excellent guidelines](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) for effective communication styles when asking for help. Raymond explains that in order to help the questionee as much as possible, you as the questioner should provide as much support as possible. *Before* you ask your question, do your part and do as much research on the topic as possible. Use your resources available to you to find the answer. Whether that be via textbooks or googling, try to put in the effort before asking your question.
After exhausting all options and finding nothing, make sure you include that in your question. "According to this article by so-and-so they instructed me to do this but that yielded no results," Or "this forum I found seemed promising but after reading through it I found nothing related to my issue at hand."
A question asked by Alexander on StackOverflow showed signs of their own efforts and an excellent use of their own time and resources that were implemented before asking the question. Alexander asks wabout the difference between React$Element and ReactElement and using flow with ReactJS. They bring up an article that they looked into that yielded no results. They also include the many examples they found with links but the error still shows up. After showing specifically what error shows up, they include possible solutions that they tried and what actually worked. They ended up finding a solution using React$Element instead of ReactElement. They then asked why this worked and where they could find information about React$Element.
Alexander does a great job in asking specific questions and offering what they already know. They also show a want to learn about the issue at hand by asking for more resources that could help.

## Stupid Ways of Asking

I learned how to program in Java and started creating very simple java programs through YouTube videos and free online recourses. After expanding this interest I applied for an online coding boot camp where I learned Full-Stack Web Design through their online curriculum.

I absolutely enjoyed my time at the coding boot camp. I learned so much from my mentors and within a few short months I was creating my own web applications. Many of my early web applications were Japanese study apps that I created to simultaneously practice both of my newly found passions.

You can see some of my early web apps on my [Projects page](https://marques-batoon.github.io/#projects)
