I was accepted as a summer intern to work at the Ehime Prefectural International Center in Ehime, Japan for three months. During the three months as an intern one of the tasks I was given was to host and present lectures and speeches in Japanese at several high schools, universities, events, and community centers.

My favorite thing about this app is that it updates on its own as the RESTful API updates without me needing to touch the original base code. So, when a new region is updated in the Pokémon games this application updates as well, as long as the API is updated as well (The most recent RESTful API data may not be as accurate since it isn't officially pulled from Nintendo). 

I also used an open source chartJS to help display the stats of each Pokémon. I tried to challenge myself and gave myself a time limit to see how far I could get creating this in one night.
